# QuintPythonChatBot

Made a basic Python-coded chatbot app using a REST API key from Openrouter.ai, and for the GUI(Graphical User Interface ), the Tkinter library was used. 
( If the bot is not giving response then please use a new api key from openrouter.ai and edit the main_code file and change the api key . As the api call is limited,  the given key gets cancelled.)
